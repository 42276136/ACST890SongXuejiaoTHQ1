(g)
The histogram of dollar values of claims has a long tail, which means higher frequency of smaller claims and also has lower frequency of larger claims. The histogram of settlement delay also has a long tail, the majority of claims can be settled within 36 months, but there are some longer delayed settlements happened after 120 months.

(j)
The histogram of log claim looks like symmetric and it looks like normal distribution with log claims concentrated between 8 and 11, and little frequency at 2 or 16. The other two plots of claim sizes or log claim sizes vs operational time both shows increasing pattern as claims and log claim sizes get larger and larger, operational time increases, which is intuitive in reality. Insurance companies usually have longer assessing time when claim amounts are high. However, the slope of log claim vs operational time is steeper than that of claim vs operational time.
